## Geolocation from a 3-Second Social Media Video

### Category
OSINT / Geolocation Analysis

### Objective
Determine the filming location of a short anonymous video using environmental,
architectural, and contextual indicators.

## Case Overview
The analyzed media was a short (~3 second) video published on social media.
The footage contained no faces, no clear landmarks, and no readable signs.

Visible elements included:
- Pavement surface
- A parked vehicle
- Light rainfall
- A brief reflection of a residential building in a car window

---

## Initial Observations
- The person in the video was walking outdoors on a paved street
- Pavement consisted of **small square stone tiles**
- Weather conditions showed **light drizzle** and wet surfaces
- Daylight conditions were present
- A residential building briefly appeared via reflection

---

## Pavement Analysis
The pavement pattern (small square stone tiles) is characteristic of:
- Germany
- Parts of Central Europe

This observation formed the initial geographic hypothesis.

---

## Weather Correlation
Based on the upload date, historical weather data was reviewed.

Observed weather indicators:
- Light rain
- Overcast daylight
- Wet pavement reflections

Regions with clear or sunny conditions at that time were excluded,
which ruled out southern Germany.

---

## Sunlight and Time Estimation
By analyzing sunlight behavior in the vehicle window reflection,
an approximate time of day was estimated.

This time range was cross-referenced with weather records to further
narrow compatible regions.

---

## Architectural Analysis (via Reflection)
A residential building appeared briefly in the reflection of a car window.

From this reflection, the following could be estimated:
- Approximate building height
- Roof angle and structure
- Architectural style consistent with German residential housing

The structure suggested:
- Low-rise housing
- A small town or village environment

---

## Urban Layout Indicators
Additional indicators supported a non-urban setting:
- Vehicle parked directly adjacent to the building
- No visible sidewalk separation
- Road and pedestrian area appeared on the same level

Such layouts are uncommon in large cities but frequent in small towns.

---

## Regional Narrowing
Combining:
- Pavement type
- Weather conditions
- Architectural style
- Urban layout

The most consistent match was **northern Germany**, specifically **Lower Saxony**.

---

## Map Verification
Using Google Maps and Street View:
- Identical pavement tile patterns were identified
- Matching residential architecture was observed
- Street layout aligned with the video indicators

A specific town within the region matched all collected indicators.

---

## Result
The filming location was successfully narrowed down to a specific town
in northern Germany based on multi-factor OSINT correlation.

The goal of this case was not exact address identification, but to
demonstrate analytical reasoning and methodology.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- OSINT methodology
- Geolocation analysis
- Weather and environmental correlation
- Architectural analysis via reflections
- Hypothesis testing and elimination
- Ethical handling of open data
