# OSINT Methodology

This case followed a standard OSINT workflow:

1. Observation
   - Identify all visible environmental indicators
   - Avoid assumptions at early stages

2. Hypothesis Building
   - Generate multiple geographic hypotheses
   - Prioritize based on unique indicators

3. Correlation
   - Cross-reference weather, architecture, and environment
   - Eliminate incompatible regions

4. Verification
   - Validate hypotheses using open mapping tools
   - Look for structural and environmental matches

5. Ethical Review
   - Exclude personal identifiers
   - Focus on methodology, not individuals
